# Jsonnet Render Extension 🎯

A VS Code extension for rendering jsonnet (`.jsonnet`) files directly inside the editor.

---

## 🔧 Features

* Auto-detects `.jsonnet` and `.libsonnet` files
* Provides a live rendering panel
* Seamlessly integrates with the VS Code sidebar
* Compares the rendered output of the current file with the Git-tracked version
* Handles imported `.libsonnet` files by evaluating against a temporary Git worktree

---

## 📂 Usage

Right-click on any `.jsonnet` or `.libsonnet` file in the **File Explorer**, and you’ll see context menu options:

> **Render Jsonnet file**
> **Render & Compare with Git Version**

* **Render Jsonnet file**: Renders the selected file to YAML and opens a virtual document.
* **Render & Compare**: Renders the file using the current working state and the last committed Git version (including all imports), and opens a diff view.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or newer)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) – JSON CLI processor
* [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) – YAML processor
* [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) – Data templating language

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dr-kosmos/jsonnet-render-extension.git
   cd jsonnet-render-extension
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension**

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

4. **Launch in VS Code**

   Press `F5` inside VS Code to open a new Extension Development Host.
   Open a `.jsonnet` file and enjoy the render panel or compare feature.

## 📦 Packaging (.vsix)

If you're too lazy to automate `.vsix` publishing (like the author), you can still build it manually:

1. Install the VS Code extension packaging tool:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   ```

2. Run:

   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```

This creates a `.vsix` file you can share or install via:

```bash
code --install-extension your-extension.vsix
```

## 🧠 Why?

Because rendering `.jsonnet` in VS Code is neat.
And nobody else bothered to make it.
