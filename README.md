# Jsonnet Render Extension 🎯

A VS Code extension for rendering jsonnet (`.jsonnet`) files directly inside the editor.

---

## 🔧 Features

* Auto-detects `.jsonnet` files
* Provides a live rendering panel
* Seamlessly integrates with the VS Code sidebar

---

## 📂 Usage

Right-click on any `.jsonnet` or `.libsonnet` file in the **File Explorer**, and you’ll see a new context menu option:

> **Render Jsonnet file**

This will trigger the rendering view for the selected file using the built-in rendering engine.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or newer)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or `npm`
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) – JSON CLI processor
* [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) – YAML processor
* [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) – Data templating language

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dr-kosmos/jsonnet-render-extension.git
   cd jsonnet-render-extension
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension**

   ```bash
   yarn build
   # or
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Launch in VS Code**

   Press `F5` inside VS Code to open a new Extension Development Host.
   Open a `.jsonnet` file and enjoy the render panel.

## 🛠️ Development Commands

| Task           | Command        | Description                             |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Install deps   | `yarn install` | Installs all dependencies               |
| Build          | `yarn build`   | Compiles TypeScript to `out/` directory |
| Watch          | `yarn watch`   | Rebuilds on file changes                |
| Start Dev Host | `yarn start`   | Opens a VS Code dev window              |

*Replace `yarn` with `npm` if needed.*

## 📦 Packaging (.vsix)

If you're too lazy to automate `.vsix` publishing (like the author), you can still build it manually:

1. Install the VS Code extension packaging tool:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   ```

2. Run:

   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```

This creates a `.vsix` file you can share or install via:

```bash
code --install-extension your-extension.vsix
```
